App Router
============================================================================

==========================
Chapter 1: Getting Started
==========================

- Creating a new project?
A. We recommend using pnpm as your package manager, as it's faster and more efficient than npm or yarn. If you don't have pnpm installed, you can install it globally by running:
npm install -g pnpm

To create a Next.js app run the following command:
npx create-next-app@latest nextjs-dashboard --example "https://github.com/vercel/next-learn/tree/main/dashboard/starter-example" --use-pnpm

This command uses create-next-app, a Command Line Interface (CLI) tool that sets up a Next.js application for you. In the command above, you're also using the --example flag with the starter example for this course.

- Folder structure?
A. /app: Contains all the routes, components, and logic for your application, this is where you'll be mostly working from.
/app/lib: Contains functions used in your application, such as reusable utility functions and data fetching functions.
/app/ui: Contains all the UI components for your application, such as cards, tables, and forms. To save time, we've pre-styled these components for you.
/public: Contains all the static assets for your application, such as images.
Config Files: You'll also notice config files such as next.config.ts at the root of your application. Most of these files are created and pre-configured when you start a new project using create-next-app. You will not need to modify them in this course.

- Running the development server?
A. Run pnpm i to install the project's packages:
pnpm i

Followed by pnpm dev to start the development server:
pnpm dev

pnpm dev starts your Next.js development server on port 3000.

======================
Chapter 2: CSS Styling
======================

- How to add a global CSS file to your application?
A. If you look inside the /app/ui folder, you'll see a file called global.css. You can use this file to add CSS rules to all the routes in your application - such as CSS reset rules, site-wide styles for HTML elements like links, and more.

You can import global.css in any component in your application, but it's usually good practice to add it to your top-level component. In Next.js, this is the root layout so to add global styles to your application navigate to /app/layout.tsx and importing the global.css file like below:
/app/layout.tsx:
import '@/app/ui/global.css';
 
export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}

- How many ways are there to add styling in Next.js?
A. Two different ways of styling: Tailwind and CSS modules.

- Define CSS Modules?
A. CSS Modules allow you to scope CSS to a component by automatically creating unique class names, so you don't have to worry about style collisions as well.

- Define clsx?
A. clsx is a library that lets you toggle class names easily. For example:
1. Suppose that you want to create an InvoiceStatus component which accepts status. The status can be 'pending' or 'paid'.
2. If it's 'paid', you want the color to be green. If it's 'pending', you want the color to be gray.

You can use clsx to conditionally apply the classes, like this:
/app/ui/invoices/status.tsx:
import clsx from 'clsx';
 
export default function InvoiceStatus({ status }: { status: string }) {
  return (
    <span
      className={clsx(
        'inline-flex items-center rounded-full px-2 py-1 text-sm',
        {
          'bg-gray-100 text-gray-500': status === 'pending',
          'bg-green-500 text-white': status === 'paid',
        },
      )}
    >
    // ...
)}

- What are the other styling solutions?
A. The following are the other styling solutions:
1. Sass which allows you to import .css and .scss files.
2. CSS-in-JS libraries such as styled-jsx, styled-components, and emotion.

- What is one benefit of using CSS modules?
A. Provide a way to make CSS classes locally scoped to components by default, reducing the risk of styling conflicts.

======================================
Chapter 3: Optimizing Fonts and Images
======================================

- Why optimize fonts is necessary?
A. Fonts play a significant role in the design of a website, but using custom fonts in your project can affect performance if the font files need to be fetched and loaded.

Cumulative Layout Shift is a metric used by Google to evaluate the performance and user experience of a website. With fonts, layout shift happens when the browser initially renders text in a fallback or system font and then swaps it out for a custom font once it has loaded. This swap can cause the text size, spacing, or layout to change, shifting elements around it.

So Next.js automatically optimizes fonts in the application when you use the next/font module. It downloads font files at build time and hosts them with your other static assets. This means when a user visits your application, there are no additional network requests for fonts which would impact performance.

- How to adding a primary font?
A. In your /app/ui folder, create a new file called fonts.ts. You'll use this file to keep the fonts that will be used throughout your application.

Import the Inter font from the next/font/google module - this will be your primary font. Then, specify what subset you'd like to load. In this case, 'latin' like:
import { Inter } from 'next/font/google';
 
export const inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] });

Finally, add the font to the <body> element in /app/layout.tsx like:
import '@/app/ui/global.css';
import { inter } from '@/app/ui/fonts';
 
export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body className={`${inter.className} antialiased`}>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}

By adding Inter to the <body> element, the font will be applied throughout your application. Here, you're also adding the Tailwind antialiased class which smooths out the font. It's not necessary to use this class, but it adds a nice touch.

Navigate to your browser, open dev tools and select the body element. You should see Inter and Inter_Fallback are now applied under styles.

- Adding a primary font?
A. In your /app/ui folder, create a new file called fonts.ts. You'll use this file to keep the fonts that will be used throughout your application.

Import the Inter font from the next/font/google module - this will be your primary font. Then, specify what subset you'd like to load. In this case, 'latin':
/app/ui/fonts.ts:
import { Inter } from 'next/font/google';
 
export const inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] });

Finally, add the font to the <body> element in /app/layout.tsx:
/app/layout.tsx:
import '@/app/ui/global.css';
import { inter } from '@/app/ui/fonts';
 
export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body className={`${inter.className} antialiased`}>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}

By adding Inter to the <body> element, the font will be applied throughout your application. Here, you're also adding the Tailwind antialiased class which smooths out the font. It's not necessary to use this class, but it adds a nice touch.

Navigate to your browser, open dev tools and select the body element. You should see Inter and Inter_Fallback are now applied under styles.

- Practice: Adding a secondary font?
A. Visit the Google Fonts website and search for Lusitana to see what options are available. Then include it into codebase like:

/app/ui/fonts.ts:
import { Inter, Lusitana } from 'next/font/google';
 
export const inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] });
 
export const lusitana = Lusitana({
  weight: ['400', '700'],
  subsets: ['latin'],
});

/app/page.tsx:
import AcmeLogo from '@/app/ui/acme-logo';
import { ArrowRightIcon } from '@heroicons/react/24/outline';
import Link from 'next/link';
import { lusitana } from '@/app/ui/fonts';
 
export default function Page() {
  return (
    // ...
    <p
      className={`${lusitana.className} text-xl text-gray-800 md:text-3xl md:leading-normal`}
    >
      <strong>Welcome to Acme.</strong> This is the example for the{' '}
      <a href="https://nextjs.org/learn/" className="text-blue-500">
        Next.js Learn Course
      </a>
      , brought to you by Vercel.
    </p>
    // ...
  );
}

- Why optimize images?
A. Next.js can serve static assets, like images, under the top-level /public folder. Files inside /public can be referenced in your application.

With regular HTML, you would add an image as follows:
<img
  src="/hero.png"
  alt="Screenshots of the dashboard project showing desktop version"
/>

However, this means you have to manually:
. Ensure your image is responsive on different screen sizes.
. Specify image sizes for different devices.
. Prevent layout shift as the images load.
. Lazy load images that are outside the user's viewport.

Image Optimization is a large topic in web development that could be considered a specialization in itself. Instead of manually implementing these optimizations, you can use the next/image component to automatically optimize your images.

- The <Image> component?
A. The <Image> Component is an extension of the HTML <img> tag, and comes with automatic image optimization, such as:

. Preventing layout shift automatically when images are loading.
. Resizing images to avoid shipping large images to devices with a smaller viewport.
. Lazy loading images by default (images load as they enter the viewport).
. Serving images in modern formats, like WebP and AVIF, when the browser supports it.

- Images without dimensions and web fonts are common causes of layout shift?
A. True.

=====================================
Chapter 4: Creating Layouts and Pages
=====================================

- Nested routing?
A. Next.js uses file-system routing where folders are used to create nested routes. Each folder represents a route segment that maps to a URL segment. For diagram: checkout nesting-routing-1.pdf file.

You can create separate UIs for each route using layout.tsx and page.tsx files.

page.tsx is a special Next.js file that exports a React component, and it's required for the route to be accessible. In your application, you already have a page file: /app/page.tsx - this is the home page associated with the route /.

To create a nested route, you can nest folders inside each other and add page.tsx files inside them. For example: checkout nesting-routing-2.pdf file.

/app/dashboard/page.tsx is associated with the /dashboard path.

- Creating the dashboard page?
A. Create a new folder called dashboard inside /app. Then, create a new page.tsx file inside the dashboard folder with the following content:
/app/dashboard/page.tsx:
export default function Page() {
  return <p>Dashboard Page</p>;
}

Now, make sure that the development server is running and visit http://localhost:3000/dashboard. You should see the "Dashboard Page" text.

This is how you can create different pages in Next.js: create a new route segment using a folder, and add a page file inside it.

By having a special name for page files, Next.js allows you to colocate UI components, test files, and other related code with your routes. Only the content inside the page file will be publicly accessible. For example, the /ui and /lib folders are colocated inside the /app folder along with your routes.

- Colocation?
A. In the app directory, nested folders define route structure. Each folder represents a route segment that is mapped to a corresponding segment in a URL path.

However, even though route structure is defined through folders, a route is not publicly accessible until a page.js or route.js file is added to a route segment. For example: checkout colocation-1.pdf file.

And, even when a route is made publicly accessible, only the content returned by page.js or route.js is sent to the client. For example: checkout colocation-2.pdf file.

This means that project files can be safely colocated inside route segments in the app directory without accidentally being routable. For example: checkout colocation-3.pdf file.

- Partial Rendering?
A. Partial rendering means only the route segments that change on navigation re-render on the client, and any shared segments are preserved. For example, when navigating between two sibling routes, /dashboard/settings and /dashboard/analytics, the settings page will be unmounted, the analytics page will be mounted with fresh state, and the shared dashboard layout will be preserved. This behavior is also present between two routes on the same dynamic segment e.g. with /blog/[slug]/page and navigating from /blog/first to /blog/second. For diagram: checkout partial-rendering.pdf file.

Without partial rendering, each navigation would cause the full page to re-render on the client. Rendering only the segment that changes reduces the amount of data transferred and execution time, leading to improved performance.

- What is the purpose of the layout file in Next.js?
A. To share UI across multiple pages.

===================================
Chapter 5: Navigating Between Pages
===================================

- Why optimize navigation?
A. To link between pages, you'd traditionally use the <a> HTML element. At the moment, the sidebar links use <a> elements, but notice what happens when you navigate between the home, invoices, and customers pages on your browser.

There's a full page refresh on each page navigation. Therefore, we need to optimize navigation.

- The <Link> component?
A. In Next.js, you can use the <Link /> Component to link between pages in your application. <Link> allows you to do client-side navigation with JavaScript.

To use the <Link /> component, open /app/ui/dashboard/nav-links.tsx, and import the Link component from next/link. Then, replace the <a> tag with <Link>:
/app/ui/dashboard/nav-links.tsx
import {
  UserGroupIcon,
  HomeIcon,
  DocumentDuplicateIcon,
} from '@heroicons/react/24/outline';
import Link from 'next/link';
 
// ...
 
export default function NavLinks() {
  return (
    <>
      {links.map((link) => {
        const LinkIcon = link.icon;
        return (
          <Link
            key={link.name}
            href={link.href}
            className="flex h-[48px] grow items-center justify-center gap-2 rounded-md bg-gray-50 p-3 text-sm font-medium hover:bg-sky-100 hover:text-blue-600 md:flex-none md:justify-start md:p-2 md:px-3"
          >
            <LinkIcon className="w-6" />
            <p className="hidden md:block">{link.name}</p>
          </Link>
        );
      })}
    </>
  );
}

- Automatic code-splitting and prefetching?
A. To improve the navigation experience, Next.js automatically code splits your application by route segments. This is different from a traditional React SPA, where the browser loads all your application code on the initial page load.

Splitting code by routes means that pages become isolated. If a certain page throws an error, the rest of the application will still work. This is also less code for the browser to parse, which makes your application faster.

Furthermore, in production, whenever <Link> components appear in the browser's viewport, Next.js automatically prefetches the code for the linked route in the background. By the time the user clicks the link, the code for the destination page will already be loaded in the background, and this is what makes the page transition near-instant!

- What does Next.js do when a <Link> component appears in the browser’s viewport in a production environment?
A. Prefetches the code for the linked route.

- usePathname?
A. usePathname is a Client Component hook that lets you read the current URL's pathname.

===================================
Chapter 6: Setting Up Your Database
===================================

- Create a Postgres database
A. Below:
i. Next, to set up a database, click Continue to Dashboard and select the Storage tab from your project dashboard. Select Create Database. Depending on when your Vercel account was created, you may see options like Neon or Supabase. Choose your preferred provider and click Continue.
ii. Choose your region and storage plan, if required. The default region for all Vercel projects is Washington D.C (iad1), and we recommend choosing this if available to reduce latency for data requests.
iii. Once connected, navigate to the .env.local tab, click Show secret and Copy Snippet. Make sure you reveal the secrets before copying them.
iv. Navigate to your code editor and rename the .env.example file to .env. Paste in the copied contents from Vercel.

- What is 'seeding' in the context of databases?
A. Populating the database with an initial set of data is known as 'seeding' in the context of databases.

========================
Chapter 7: Fetching Data
========================

- Choosing how to fetch data?
A. Below:
API layer
APIs are an intermediary layer between your application code and database. There are a few cases where you might use an API:

. If you're using third-party services that provide an API.
. If you're fetching data from the client, you want to have an API layer that runs on the server to avoid exposing your database secrets to the client.
. In Next.js, you can create API endpoints using Route Handlers.

Database queries
When you're creating a full-stack application, you'll also need to write logic to interact with your database. For relational databases like Postgres, you can do this with SQL or with an ORM.

There are a few cases where you have to write database queries:

. When creating your API endpoints, you need to write logic to interact with your database.
. If you are using React Server Components (fetching data on the server), you can skip the API layer, and query your database directly without risking exposing your database secrets to the client.

- In which of these scenarios should you not query your database directly?
A. When you're fetching data on the client

- Using Server Components to fetch data?
A. By default, Next.js applications use React Server Components. Fetching data with Server Components is a relatively new approach and there are a few benefits of using them:

. Server Components support JavaScript Promises, providing a solution for asynchronous tasks like data fetching natively. You can use async/await syntax without needing useEffect, useState or other data fetching libraries.
. Server Components run on the server, so you can keep expensive data fetches and logic on the server, only sending the result to the client.
. Since Server Components run on the server, you can query the database directly without an additional API layer. This saves you from writing and maintaining additional code.

- What's one advantage of using React Server Components to fetch data?
A. They allow you to query the database directly from the server without an additional API layer.

- Using SQL?
A. For your dashboard application, you'll write database queries using the postgres.js library and SQL. There are a few reasons why we'll be using SQL:

. SQL is the industry standard for querying relational databases (e.g. ORMs generate SQL under the hood).
. Having a basic understanding of SQL can help you understand the fundamentals of relational databases, allowing you to apply your knowledge to other tools.
. SQL is versatile, allowing you to fetch and manipulate specific data.
. The postgres.js library provides protection against SQL injections.

- What does SQL allow you to do in terms of fetching data?
A. Fetch and manipulate specific data.

- Fetching data for the dashboard overview page
A. Now that you understand different ways of fetching data, let's fetch data for the dashboard overview page. Navigate to /app/dashboard/page.tsx, paste the following code, and spend some time exploring it:

import { Card } from '@/app/ui/dashboard/cards';
import RevenueChart from '@/app/ui/dashboard/revenue-chart';
import LatestInvoices from '@/app/ui/dashboard/latest-invoices';
import { lusitana } from '@/app/ui/fonts';
 
export default async function Page() {
  return (
    <main>
      <h1 className={`${lusitana.className} mb-4 text-xl md:text-2xl`}>
        Dashboard
      </h1>
      <div className="grid gap-6 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4">
        {/* <Card title="Collected" value={totalPaidInvoices} type="collected" /> */}
        {/* <Card title="Pending" value={totalPendingInvoices} type="pending" /> */}
        {/* <Card title="Total Invoices" value={numberOfInvoices} type="invoices" /> */}
        {/* <Card
          title="Total Customers"
          value={numberOfCustomers}
          type="customers"
        /> */}
      </div>
      <div className="mt-6 grid grid-cols-1 gap-6 md:grid-cols-4 lg:grid-cols-8">
        {/* <RevenueChart revenue={revenue}  /> */}
        {/* <LatestInvoices latestInvoices={latestInvoices} /> */}
      </div>
    </main>
  );
}

The code above is intentionally commented out. We will now begin to example each piece.

. The page is an async server component. This allows you to use await to fetch data.
. There are also 3 components which receive data: <Card>, <RevenueChart>, and <LatestInvoices>. They are currently commented out and not yet implemented.

- Fetching data for <RevenueChart/>
A. To fetch data for the <RevenueChart/> component, import the fetchRevenue function from data.ts and call it inside your component:
import { Card } from '@/app/ui/dashboard/cards';
import RevenueChart from '@/app/ui/dashboard/revenue-chart';
import LatestInvoices from '@/app/ui/dashboard/latest-invoices';
import { lusitana } from '@/app/ui/fonts';
import { fetchRevenue } from '@/app/lib/data';
 
export default async function Page() {
  const revenue = await fetchRevenue();
  // ...
}

Next, let's do the following:
. Uncomment the <RevenueChart/> component.
. Navigate to the component file (/app/ui/dashboard/revenue-chart.tsx) and uncomment the code inside it.
. Check localhost:3000 and you should see a chart that uses revenue data.

- Fetching data for <LatestInvoices/>
A. For the <LatestInvoices /> component, we need to get the latest 5 invoices, sorted by date.

You could fetch all the invoices and sort through them using JavaScript. This isn't a problem as our data is small, but as your application grows, it can significantly increase the amount of data transferred on each request and the JavaScript required to sort through it.

Instead of sorting through the latest invoices in-memory, you can use an SQL query to fetch only the last 5 invoices. For example, this is the SQL query from your data.ts file:
// Fetch the last 5 invoices, sorted by date
const data = await sql<LatestInvoiceRaw[]>`
  SELECT invoices.amount, customers.name, customers.image_url, customers.email
  FROM invoices
  JOIN customers ON invoices.customer_id = customers.id
  ORDER BY invoices.date DESC
  LIMIT 5`;

In your page, import the fetchLatestInvoices function:
import { Card } from '@/app/ui/dashboard/cards';
import RevenueChart from '@/app/ui/dashboard/revenue-chart';
import LatestInvoices from '@/app/ui/dashboard/latest-invoices';
import { lusitana } from '@/app/ui/fonts';
import { fetchRevenue, fetchLatestInvoices } from '@/app/lib/data';
 
export default async function Page() {
  const revenue = await fetchRevenue();
  const latestInvoices = await fetchLatestInvoices();
  // ...
}

Then, uncomment the <LatestInvoices /> component. You will also need to uncomment the relevant code in the <LatestInvoices /> component itself, located at /app/ui/dashboard/latest-invoices.

If you visit your localhost, you should see that only the last 5 are returned from the database. Hopefully, you're beginning to see the advantages of querying your database directly!

- Define Static Rendering?
a. By default, Next.js prerenders routes to improve performance, this is called Static Rendering. So if your data changes, it won't be reflected in your dashboard.

- What are request waterfalls?
A. A "waterfall" refers to a sequence of network requests that depend on the completion of previous requests. In the case of data fetching, each request can only begin once the previous request has returned data.

For example, we need to wait for fetchRevenue() to execute before fetchLatestInvoices() can start running, and so on:
const revenue = await fetchRevenue();
const latestInvoices = await fetchLatestInvoices(); // wait for fetchRevenue() to finish
const {
  numberOfInvoices,
  numberOfCustomers,
  totalPaidInvoices,
  totalPendingInvoices,
} = await fetchCardData(); // wait for fetchLatestInvoices() to finish

This pattern is not necessarily bad. There may be cases where you want waterfalls because you want a condition to be satisfied before you make the next request. For example, you might want to fetch a user's ID and profile information first. Once you have the ID, you might then proceed to fetch their list of friends. In this case, each request is contingent on the data returned from the previous request.

However, this behavior can also be unintentional and impact performance.

- When might you want to use a waterfall pattern?
A. To satisfy a condition before making the next request

- Parallel data fetching
A. A common way to avoid waterfalls is to initiate all data requests at the same time - in parallel.

In JavaScript, you can use the Promise.all() or Promise.allSettled() functions to initiate all promises at the same time. For example, in data.ts, we're using Promise.all() in the fetchCardData() function:
export async function fetchCardData() {
  try {
    const invoiceCountPromise = sql`SELECT COUNT(*) FROM invoices`;
    const customerCountPromise = sql`SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers`;
    const invoiceStatusPromise = sql`SELECT
         SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'paid' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS "paid",
         SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'pending' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS "pending"
         FROM invoices`;
 
    const data = await Promise.all([
      invoiceCountPromise,
      customerCountPromise,
      invoiceStatusPromise,
    ]);
    // ...
  }
}

By using this pattern, you can:

Start executing all data fetches at the same time, which is faster than waiting for each request to complete in a waterfall.
Use a native JavaScript pattern that can be applied to any library or framework.
